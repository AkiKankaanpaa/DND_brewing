When creating plants, if a value for a specific attribute of a plant does
not exist, instead enter "0" as the value, and the program will properly
identify it as such. This is not true for effects for attributes, as those
should be left empty ("") so that no unnecessary attributes nor effects
are added and thus the DC for the crafting would be higher than it should be.

Names should be entered all in lowercase to prevent problems with the
search functions.
